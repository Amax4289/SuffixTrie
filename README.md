# SuffixTrie


Create a program with which the user selects a text file (which has English text), and the program reads the contents of the file, 
and then enters a recycle where the user will give a query and the system will return where found (if found) the query.
Your program should print how long it took to create the suffix trie (done once at the beginning) and how long each search took.
Test your program on very large files and comment on the performance (in a short report).
